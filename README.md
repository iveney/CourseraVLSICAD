===============

Open-source components for our course. This project lists the parts that are both public and open so that others who are interested in re-implementing some of the features may benefit. There is another closed source version that handles the actual grading. Thus, the integrity of the grades is not compromised.

Here are the main components of this repository. Each one can be run separately.

Submitter
---------

A user interface for submitting assignments and also viewing the results of the submission.

Grader
------

The Groovy backend for lauching external graders.

External Process Examples
-------------------------

Some simple examples of running external processes through Groovy.
